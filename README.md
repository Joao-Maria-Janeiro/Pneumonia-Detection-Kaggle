# Pneumonia-Detection-Kaggle
CNN for the Pneumonia identification Kaggle dataset

## Attempts
First I tried to use transfer learning but the network was not being able to learn very well, I tried a couple with different amount of dense layers, none of them did very well so I decided to implement my own network that got better results. The results are on par with some of the best submissions for the dataset with little overfitting.

I used [this participant's](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/notebooks) data preprocessing.
